READMEMilboost_2.py: MILBOOST modelMil_test.py:  use MUSK dataset to test the MILBOOST model:* Training data: MUSK2 * Change training set: o For every instance in each bag, there are m features are going to be change, and then concatenate the new instances with the prior instanceso m is the number of features that is going to be changed in each instance * I test two list of m:* First: from m=0 to m<= 166: m += 2 (prediction accuracy.png)* Second: m = 0, and from m = 1 to m <= 166: m*=2 (prediction accuracy2.png)* Now m in the code is the second list* randomly select m index (between 0 to 166, which is the number of all features) and change the featureMUSK: datasetJust run the mil_test.py to get the figure
